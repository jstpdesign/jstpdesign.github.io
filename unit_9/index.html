					<h2>More about me</h2>
					<p>Born and raised right outside of New Orleans, I have worked for a handful of newspapers since attending LSU. I started my career in 2009 as a news designer at the Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss. </p>
					<p>From there, I moved to Colorado Springs where I became the lead sports designer at the The Gazette. I held the same position at The World-Herald in Omaha, Neb. I picked up tabloid and digital design experience when I worked at RedEye in Chicago before heading north to Minneapolis.</p>
					<p>When I'm not designing sports, I'm usually watching them. Football is my sport of choice, but I also enjoy baseball in the summer and basketball in the winter. My other pastimes include hanging out with my family, especially my nephews, watching movies and cooking for my friends and coworkers.</p>
